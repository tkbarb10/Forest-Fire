Step-by-Step Instructions

Load and explore the Forest Fires dataset, understanding the features and target variable

Preprocess the data, handling any missing values and encoding categorical variables

Perform feature engineering, creating interaction terms and polynomial features

Implement a baseline linear regression model and evaluate its performance

Apply k-fold cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of model performance

Implement Ridge and Lasso regression models to address overfitting

Use grid search with cross-validation to optimize regularization hyperparameters

Compare the performance of different models using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, R-squared)

Interpret the final model, identifying the most important features for predicting fire damage

Visualize the results and discuss the model's limitations and potential improvements
